To do list (*) / ideas (^)
==========================

* separate scene description from canvas and camera
* log rendering parameters along with render filename
* BRDF should not take into account actual radiance of ray (assume it as one [1])

^ add spectrum definition by color temp and power (for lights)
^ add spectrum definition by RGB #RRGGBB (0->1)
^ add ability to dump all paths to a file and retrieve them for reprocessing
^ experiment: multi-pass rendering (pixel variance is lower for low spp)
^ decouple serializer from objects
