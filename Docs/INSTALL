Setup of development environment (Linux)
========================================

NetBeans 6 for C++ are used to develop H-RayTracer. In the following
steps we present a way to setup development environment in Debian
GNU/Linux (version lenny).


0. GNU C++ Compiler

First of all, you need a compiler. We are using gcc-4.2. It is probably
already installed on your linux machine. If not - use apt-get to install
it.


1. Install NetBeans

You will need two things. First is Sun JDK 6. In debian/lenny this
is a package named sun-java6-jdk. It's probably in non-free package
repository.

Next step is downloading and installing NetBeans 6. You can obtain
a copy from http://netbeans.org (click download and get C++ version).
Just download and run setup as root.


2. Install needed libraries

H-RT is using a couple of open source libraries. You have to install
libraries in order to build all the projects. This is the list of libs:

 libgsl0-dev
 libgmp3-dev
 libfreeimage-dev
 libboost-dev
 libboost-program-options-dev
 libboost-thread-dev
 libboost-date-time-dev

Just use 'apt-get install <libs>' to get these libs.


3. Install libyaml-0.0.1

H-RT is also using experimental YAML parser library. You have to download
its sources, compile it and install. Here's the recipe:

 a) get libyaml from http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML
 b) unpak it somewhere and go to its directory
 c) ./configure
 d) make
 e) sudo make install


After all these steps you should have all stuff needed to build and develop
H-RayTracer. Just run netbeans and open project called HrtRender with all
its dependent projects (by using a checkbox in the open project dialog).

Have fun! :)

PS. We abandoned support for Visual Studio. If you want to develop H-RT under 
Windows we suggest to use VirtualBox and install Debian on a virtual machine.
